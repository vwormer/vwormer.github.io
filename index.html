    <h1> Hello world! <br>I'm <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Remrow" target="_blank">Vanessa</a>.</br></h1>

       <p>
	 I'm a data journalist working with <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de" target="_blank">SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung</a> in Munich and member of the <a href="http://www.panamapapers.de" target="_blank">Panama Papers</a> investigation team. I'm passionate about the opportunities new technologies offer to journalism.
	  </p> 
        <p>
	 In 2015 I passed the <a href="http://ledeprogram.com" target="_blank">Lede Program</a> in Computing and Data Science at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in New York City. Before, I used to work as an Online Editor at the German local newspaper Heilbronner Stimme and was Rudolf Augstein data fellow at the investigative office <a href="http://www.correctiv.org" target="_blank">CORRECT!V</a> in Berlin.</p>
       </p> 
 
        <p> 
        Currently I'm co-organizer of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Hacks-Hackers-Munchen/" target="_blank">Hacks/Hackers Munich</a> and member of the open data community <a href="http://www.codefor.de" target="_blank">Code for Germany</a>. Further, I've been writing about data journalism and other media stuff on my blog <a href="http://hashtagdigilab.tumblr.com" target="_blank">#DIGILAB</a> and speak about these topics at <a href="https://speakerinnen.org/en/profiles/875" target="_blank">conferences</a>.  
        </p> 

        <p>
    	Yet the best thing on earth I cannot do on the internet: I enjoy packing my backpack and hiking through the awesome Alps.
